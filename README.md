- **Coding**: Developing efficient solutions and scripts that streamline workflows.
- **Infrastructure**: Designing scalable, resilient, and cost-effective infrastructure using tools like **AWS**, **Terraform**, and **Docker**.

I thrive in environments where I can continuously learn, collaborate, and contribute to building cutting-edge, reliable systems. As I transition into **DevOps/SRE**, I am excited to contribute to teams that value both **innovation** and **reliability**.
